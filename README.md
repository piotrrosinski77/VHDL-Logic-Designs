# VHDL-Logic-Designs

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of digital logic designs implemented using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). These projects are intended for use in FPGA and ASIC designs and are aimed at showcasing a variety of logic designs and circuits fundamental to digital systems.

## Requirements

- VHDL Compiler: Any compatible VHDL compiler (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim)
- Simulator: To run and verify testbenches (e.g., GHDL, ModelSim)
